# Challenge 2: Intro to Arguments
In this challenge, to get the flag, I had to run the hello command (NOT the echo command) with a single argument of hackers.

## My solve
**Flag:** ` pwn.college{c_4wJpoIBDEksB2efdLmnzi7saj.QX4YjM1wCN2MzNzEzW}â€™

```
hacker@hello~intro-to-arguments:~$ hello hackers
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{c_4wJpoIBDEksB2efdLmnzi7saj.QX4YjM1wCN2MzNzEzW}
```
