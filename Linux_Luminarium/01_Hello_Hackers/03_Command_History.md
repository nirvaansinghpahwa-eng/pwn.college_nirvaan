# Challenge 3: Command History
 This challenge will inject the flag into your history. Bring up a terminal, hit the up arrow, and grab it! In other challenges, the history will contain the log of the commands you've run, so if you need to run a similar command again, you can use the arrow keys to scroll through and find it!

## My solve
**Flag:** ` pwn.college{88VqWiAm9-z-hiCHR4F6sOVkIcg.0lNzEzNxwCN2MzNzEzW}’

```
hacker@hello~command-history:~$ the flag is pwn.college{88VqWiAm9-z-hiCHR4F6sOVkIcg.0lNzEzNxwCN2MzNzEzW}
