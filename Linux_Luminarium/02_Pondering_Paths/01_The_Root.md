# Challenge 1: The Root
In this challenge I had to launch a terminal, invoke the pwn program using its absolute path, and Capture the Flag.
 

## My solve
**Flag:** ` pwn.college{gsiCCzbabJMCehX53VwrdGGIFyZ.QX4cTO0wCN2MzNzEzW} â€™

```
hacker@paths~the-root:~$ /pwn
BOOM!!!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{gsiCCzbabJMCehX53VwrdGGIFyZ.QX4cTO0wCN2MzNzEzW}
```
