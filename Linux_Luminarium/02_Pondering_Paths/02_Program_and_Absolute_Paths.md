# Challenge 2: Program and Absolute Paths
In this challenge I had to execute the run file that is in the challenge directory that is, in turn, in the / directory.

## My solve
**Flag:** ` pwn.college{4a96vG7p1IF_pp8I60Deh2AJzO5.QX1QTN0wCN2MzNzEzW}â€™

```
hacker@paths~program-and-absolute-paths:~$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{4a96vG7p1IF_pp8I60Deh2AJzO5.QX1QTN0wCN2MzNzEzW}

```

## What I learned
How to invoke a file which is nested in another directory.

## Incorrect tangents
