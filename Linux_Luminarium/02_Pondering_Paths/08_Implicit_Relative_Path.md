# Challenge 8: Implicit Relative Paths
In this challenge I had to execute a program in the current directory, using . like in the previous levels.

## My solve
**Flag:** ` pwn.college{AY-U-7LeHqEuj2mk0D2R9fqVhwe.QXxUTN0wCN2MzNzEzW}’

```
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-path:~$ cd /challenge
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-path:/challenge$ ./run
Correct!!!
./run is a relative path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{AY-U-7LeHqEuj2mk0D2R9fqVhwe.QXxUTN0wCN2MzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

## Incorrect tangents
