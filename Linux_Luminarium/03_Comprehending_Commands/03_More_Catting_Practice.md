# Challenge 3: More Catting practice
In this challenge, I had to go read the flag file which was in a given directory ‘/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/girepository-1.0/flag’ with cat.

## My solve
**Flag:** ` pwn.college{oNEE1QPqflpK8mfl3vtU1O3CnzQ.QXwITO0wCN2MzNzEzW}’


```
hacker@commands~more-catting-practice:~$ cat /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/girepository-1.0/flag
pwn.college{oNEE1QPqflpK8mfl3vtU1O3CnzQ.QXwITO0wCN2MzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
To read the contents of a file without using cd and directly using cat.
