# Challenge 4: Grepping for a Needle in a Haystack
In this challenge, I had to search for the flag using the grep command in a file data.txt which contained thousands of strings.

## My solve
**Flag:** ` pwn.college{QHijC9wlwt86t2h16SacaHTRbDm.QX3EDO0wCN2MzNzEzW}â€™


```
hacker@commands~grepping-for-a-needle-in-a-haystack:~$ grep pwn.college /challenge/data.txt
pwn.college{QHijC9wlwt86t2h16SacaHTRbDm.QX3EDO0wCN2MzNzEzW}
```
