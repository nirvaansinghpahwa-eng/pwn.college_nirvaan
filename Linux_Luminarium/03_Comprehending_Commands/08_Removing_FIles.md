# Challenge 8: Removing Files
This challenge will create a delete_me file in your home directory! Delete it, then run /challenge/check, which will make sure you've deleted it and then give you the flag!

## My solve
**Flag:** ` pwn.college{QzWmW1rCK9O6DNy_ozbfy86VbaW.QX2kDM1wCN2MzNzEzW}â€™


```
hacker@commands~removing-files:~$ rm delete_me
hacker@commands~removing-files:~$ /challenge/check
Excellent removal. Here is your reward:
pwn.college{QzWmW1rCK9O6DNy_ozbfy86VbaW.QX2kDM1wCN2MzNzEzW}
