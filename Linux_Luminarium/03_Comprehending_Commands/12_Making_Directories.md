# Challenge 12: Making Directories
In this challenge, I had to create a /tmp/pwn directory and make a college file in it! Then run /challenge/run.

## My solve
**Flag:** ` pwn.college{EYj8jSxxNmPRBMBy403e4yY_7n_.QXxMDO0wCN2MzNzEzW}â€™


```
hacker@commands~making-directories:~$ mkdir /tmp/pwn
hacker@commands~making-directories:~$ cd /tmp/pwn
hacker@commands~making-directories:/tmp/pwn$ touch college
hacker@commands~making-directories:/tmp/pwn$ /challenge/run
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{EYj8jSxxNmPRBMBy403e4yY_7n_.QXxMDO0wCN2MzNzEzW}
```
