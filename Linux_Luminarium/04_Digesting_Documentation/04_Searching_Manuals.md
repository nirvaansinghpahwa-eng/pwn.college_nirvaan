# Challenge 4: Searching Manuals
In this challenge, I had to use man command and search for the argument to /challenge/challenge that would give me the flag.

## My solve
**Flag:** ` pwn.college{AUVfCnzCArvACk7d8AgTm2WYB7c.QX1EDO0wCN2MzNzEzW}â€™


```
hacker@man~searching-manuals:~$ man challenge
hacker@man~searching-manuals:~$ /challenge/challenge --hbx
Initializing...
Correct usage! Your flag: pwn.college{AUVfCnzCArvACk7d8AgTm2WYB7c.QX1EDO0wCN2MzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
Using / to search for a word in the manual and using n to go to the next appearance of the word and using N to go to the previous. Also using ? to search backwards.

## Incorrect tangents
None

## References
None
