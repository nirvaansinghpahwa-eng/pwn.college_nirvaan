# Challenge 1: Matching with *
In this challenge, I had to use file globbing to change the directory to /challenge but the argument cd could have should just be 4 characters.

## My solve
**Flag:** ` pwn.college{8wMAofHYRXr9cc0m7cTFGjTpqGx.QXxIDO0wCN2MzNzEzW}â€™


```
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /c*e
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$ ./run
You ran me with the working directory of /challenge! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{8wMAofHYRXr9cc0m7cTFGjTpqGx.QXxIDO0wCN2MzNzEzW}
```
