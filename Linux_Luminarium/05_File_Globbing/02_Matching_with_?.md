# Challenge 2: Matching with ?
In this challenge, I had to use ? to replace the characters c and l in challenge and then run /challenge/run.

## My solve
**Flag:** ` pwn.college{sjBdJg2M2cbpgkcjhimWGbm9UjN.QXyIDO0wCN2MzNzEzW}â€™


```
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /?ha??enge
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$ ./run
You ran me with the working directory of /challenge! Here is your flag:

```
