# Challenge 5: Multiple Globs
In this challenge, I had to use multiple *s to provide a 3 character argument to /challenge/run that covered every word that contained the letter p.

## My solve
**Flag:** ` pwn.college{MlJcsr6rwaBuvT47YEp1imipQFV.0lM3kjNxwCN2MzNzEzW}â€™


```
hacker@globbing~multiple-globs:~$ cd /challenge/files
hacker@globbing~multiple-globs:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run *p*
You got it! Here is your flag!
