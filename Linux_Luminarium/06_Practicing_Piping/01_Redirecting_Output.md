# Challenge 1: Redirecting Output
In this challenge, I had to use output redirection to redirect PWN to COLLEGE

## My solve
**Flag:** ` pwn.college{UXagOhYULj45MubUeOiejL_4Be0.QX0YTN0wCN2MzNzEzW}â€™


```
hacker@piping~redirecting-output:~$ echo PWN > COLLEGE
Correct! You successfully redirected 'PWN' to the file 'COLLEGE'! Here is your 
flag:
pwn.college{UXagOhYULj45MubUeOiejL_4Be0.QX0YTN0wCN2MzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
Redirection of output takes place by using echo (output) > (file).

## Incorrect tangents
None

## References
